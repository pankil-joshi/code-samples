Such Third Party Services are made available only as a convenience, and your purchase, access or use of any such Third Party Services is solely between you and the applicable third party services provider (“Third Party Provider”).

    <p>We do not provide any warranties with respect to Third Party Services. You acknowledge that Tagzie has no control over Third Party Services, and shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for such
        Third Party Services. The availability of Third Party Services on Tagzie’s websites, including the Tagzie app, or the integration or enabling of such Third Party Services with the Services does not constitute or imply an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by or with Tagzie. Tagzie strongly recommends that you seek specialist advice before using or relying on Third Party Services, to ensure they will meet your needs. In particular, tax calculators should be used for reference only and not as a substitute for independent tax advice when assessing the correct tax rates you should charge to your customers.</p>
    <p>If you install or enable a Third Party Service for use with the Services, you grant us permission to allow the applicable Third Party Provider to access your data and to take any other actions as required for the interoperation of the Third Party Service with the Services, and any exchange of data or other interaction between you and the Third Party Provider is solely between you and such Third Party Provider.

    <p>Under no circumstances shall Tagzie be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever that result from any Third Party Services or your contractual relationship with any Third Party Provider, including any Expert. These limitations shall apply even if Tagzie has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, Tagzie partners, officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of your use of a Third Party Service or your relationship with a Third Party Provider.</p>
    <h4>13. IP Infringement and Takedown Procedure</h4>
    <p>Tagzie supports the protection of intellectual property and asks Tagzie merchants to do the same. It's our policy to respond to all notices of alleged copyright infringement. If someone believes that one of our merchants are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, they can send an infringement notice to us by emailing us on <a href="mailto:copyright@tagzie.com">copyright@tagzie.com.</a> Upon receiving an infringement, we may remove or disable access to the material claimed to be a copyright infringement. Once provided with a notice of takedown, the merchant can reply with a counter notification using our form if they object to the complaint. The original complainant has 14 business days after we receive a counter notification to seek a court order restraining the merchant from engaging in the infringing activity, otherwise we will restore the material. For more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:copyright@tagzie.com">copyright@tagzie.com.</a></p>
